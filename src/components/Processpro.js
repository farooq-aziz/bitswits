                                <h2>Project Scoping</h2>
                                <p>Our app developers in Dubai connect with our clients to understand their requirements. This scoping session is also being overlooked by our technical consultants, who are tasked to identify and streamline the best technologies, development methodology, and other factors that are critical to the success of your mobile application:</p>
                                <p>Requirement Analysis. Here's what the phase includes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Market Research</li>

                                <h2>Strategic Planning</h2>
                                <p>Once the requirements are understood by our mobile app developers in UAE, a strategic plan is developed right after the initial scoping, brainstorming, conceptualization, pre-development prep, and other processes are completed.</p>
                                <p>This strategic plan describes the best app development approach that our app development company in Dubai will take and the time that will be required to develop your application. In a nutshell, here's what you can expect in this phase:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Identifying Product's Objective</li>
                                    <li>TAM Finalization</li>

                                <h2>Design Phase</h2>
                                <p>The design phase is the part where an initial design (Screens, UI/UX, Visuals, Aesthetics, Etc.) is created and sent to the concerned individual for approval. Meetings can also be scheduled to review the design of the mobile application.</p>
                                <p>Any suggestions, feedback, or recommendations are recorded during this process, and corrections are made before moving on to the next phase, which is development. Like any other app development phase, this phase also includes various stages, i.e.:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Designing Sketches</li>
                                    <li>Wireframing</li>
                                    <li>Design Mock-ups</li>
                                    <li>Prototyping & Designing</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3 className='mt-5'>04</h3>
                                <h2>Development Phase</h2>
                                <p>In the development phase, our app developers in Dubai create the functionality of the product. If the product is cross-platform, we start with developing your Android app first because Android apps are comparatively easier to build, test and deploy. Once the development of both your iOS and Android app ends, the apps are moved to the initial testing stage, where experienced app developers in Dubai test your applications for performance and functionality. The following are some aspects that go hand in hand with the development of your mobile app's development:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Custom Application Development</li>
                                    <li>Integrating Latest Technologies</li>
                                    <li>Ensuring Robustness & Scalability</li>
                                    <li>Completing Source Codes & IP Rights</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3 className='mt-5'>05</h3>
                                <h2>Feedback & Iterations</h2>
                                <p>The feedback and reiterations phase involves presenting the mobile application to the client to receive valuable feedback. The app is only presented once it is tested for functionality and performance, and since we're the pioneering app development company in Dubai, we ensure that the presented application hits the 70% approval mark while the rest is changed as per the client's direction.</p>

                                <h3 className='mt-5'>06</h3>
                                <h2>Incorporating Content</h2>
                                <p>Passing the feedback phase, we ask you to deliver your content so that it can be incorporated into your app where needed. Our mobile app developers in Dubai carefully align content with the design of the app, ensuring that the experience is amplified instead of being compromised.</p>

                                <h3 className='mt-5'>07</h3>
                                <h2>Quality Assurance Phase</h2>
                                <p>The quality assurance phase of Bitswits is led by a team of top Q/A engineers and specialists that are directed to thoroughly test the app for usability, performance, functionality, features, experience on multiple devices, identify bugs, errors, and lags, and more to determine the quality of the application.</p>
                                <p>Once our Q/A engineers give us a heads-up on the standard and quality of the app, that's when Bitswits, the leading mobile app development company, presents the finalized version of the app to you.</p>

                                <h3 className='mt-5'>08</h3>
                                <h2>Launch & Deployment</h2>
                                <p>The app leaves you mesmerized when you see it, and once your approval is granted, we go on to submit the app to the Play Store and App Store for approval and publishing.</p>

                                <p>Once published, our Android and iOS App developers in UAE start working on the updates that your app will receive after analyzing the feedback that is received from users, but this is a long-term project, and the support is only there to make your app stronger and keep it up to date. Here are some other aspects involved in this process:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Optimizing Your App's Presences</li>
                                    <li>Dedicated Assistance by Customer Service</li>
                                    <li>Software Licensing</li>
                                </ul>
