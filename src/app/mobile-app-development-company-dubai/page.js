            <p class='fontsfregular'>However, you can monetize your app through various methods, such as advertisements and in-app purchases, or by implementing a revenue model to unlock cash flow.</p>
            <p class='fontsfregular'>Monetizing your app effectively is crucial for generating revenue despite the lack of direct payment from the Google Play Store for downloads.</p>
