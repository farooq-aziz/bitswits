            question: "How much does mobile app development cost in NYC?",
            answer: (
              <>
                Building a software or mobile application is both complicated and expensive. App developers in NYC usually charge an average of $45 per hour. Similarly, front-end developers, designers, project managers, etc. charge more or less the same hourly rate. Assuming you’re building native apps for both iOS and Android, and your LOE is somewhere around 1200  - 1500 for a single version, the cost of app development could easily go above $100,000. And that’s where BitsWits come to help! <br />

                BitsWits has offices in around 7 countries with production houses across Pakistan, UAE, and the USA. The hourly rates are cheaper here with slightly better development quality. Thus, if you work with us, you can easily get the same app within $25k to $40k.

              "Do I need to build separate Android and iOS versions of my app?",
            answer: (
              <>
                Building separate Android and iOS versions of your app depends on your target audience and business goals. While native apps offer better performance and user experience, they require separate development for each platform. Alternatively, you can opt for cross-platform app development to save time and resources while reaching a wider audience.

              "Are there any drawbacks of cross-platform app development?",
            answer: (
              <>
                While cross-platform app development offers benefits like reduced development time and cost, there are some drawbacks to consider. Cross-platform apps may not offer the same level of performance or user experience as native apps. They may also have limitations in accessing platform-specific features and capabilities.

                No, you don't have to pay all at once for mobile app development. Most app development companies offer flexible payment options, including milestone-based payments.
                For instance, BitsWits offers you the flexibility to divide your project into several stages and get started with the alpha development fee.

            answer: (
              <>
                You can hire a freelance app developer in NYC if you already have an existing in-house team and need to augment it for better results. Besides that, hiring a freelance app developer is not the right approach. While it might seem a little cost effective and monitorable, the overall cost and results are not guaranteed and the only person who's accountable for any mishap is you. At the same time, hiring an app development company in NYC like BitsWits gives you freedom to be as flexible and customizable as you want. Plus, you can check the portfolio of an app development company and see if they’re capable of building something similar to what you are looking for.

            answer: (
              <>
                <p>The most important factor when hiring an app development company is the pricing. For top-end brands with unlimited means of funding and resources, hiring an app development company is a no-brainer as they can afford to work with app development companies like Accenture where pricing starts from $1 Million. </p>
                <p>
                  However, for mid-level and low-end brands who’re bootstrapping their startups, pricing and time to market are two of the most important factors. The best way to find an app development company in NYC that resonates with your values and beliefs is to search on top review platforms like Clutch, shortlist a few app development companies, and interview their teams to see if they are a fit or not.
